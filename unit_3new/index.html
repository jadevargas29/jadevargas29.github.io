		<p>we adopted Cooper from a wire-fox terrier breeder in Kansas when he was eight weeks old. he was a tiny ball of fluff and needles; teething is no joke. with lots of ruined toys, nipped-at hands, and two sizes of "calm coats," we guided cooper through puppy-hood. now he is almost thirty pounds but still insists on sitting squarely on your lap. prone to rolling around, laughable growling, and nose nudges.</p>
