		I decided to immerse myself in web design when I realized amplifying DNA and isolating proteins wasn't really satisfying me creatively. A longtime lover of typography and collages, I had never really tried my hand at anything web-based except MySpace layouts. What resulted is a passion for clean, beautiful, user-friendly designs and the tools to make them happen.
